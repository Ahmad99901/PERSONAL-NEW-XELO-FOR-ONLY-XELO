  <h1>Q&A</h1>
  
    <h4>Who is the FOUNDER of XELO BOT?</h4>
    <p>Greetings my name is Zeetom,
    <br>I am an aspiring future software engineer who wishes to learn, adapt, and create as many projects as possible</p>
    <h4>Purpose behind making XELO BOT?</h4>
    <p>I wanted to create a combination project involving a discord bot and then making a website for XELO so other users could feel free to download him. 
    <br>I wanted to learn Python, HTML, and CSS to its fullest potential while having fun creating what I love</p>
    <h4>Any future plans for XELO?</h4>
    <p>When I learn Javascript or C++ and have mastery in those coding languages, then I will revist and see if I can add more</p>
    <h4>Where is the image from? (XELO BOT)</h4>
    <p>Image credit is given to the great reading series ORDEAL, highly recommend</p>
    <h4>What is your favorite coding language</h4>
    <p>At the moment C++, even though im still a beginner, I already love the way the use of functions works in C++ versus Python</p>
