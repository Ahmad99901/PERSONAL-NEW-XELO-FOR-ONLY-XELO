#Name - Ahmad #Date - 05/22/24 #Project - Website for Xelo Discord Bot

This is my second website coded with HTML/CSS. Soon I will integrate Javascript for some nice animations.  I've decided to make a combination project by creating a discord bot and then making a website for Users to see its function and install from. 

I've decided to completely change up the template from my previous website o see different ways to organize elements, in the XELO website we now have many body sections and only 1 page.  I value quality over quantity so decided to see how much I can improve on one page websites.

**THE PAGE**

Header - Download link for the Xelo discord bot

Body section - Listing basic discord bot functions

Body section 2 - Listing Commands of Xelo Bot

Body section 3 - Q%A about the bot/me 

Body section 4 - Simply an image showing the commands being used in discord

Footer - Simply a footer (if real website with domain, would provide business info such as email/location/etc)

Huge thanks as always to LearnCodeAcademy for being the reason I am able to create and improve on websites and showing the key components to be a great web designer. Thank you to everyone who sees this!
